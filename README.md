## 🚀 Introduction
This digital portfolio serves as a comprehensive record of my learning journey in **BERR4723 Digital Image Processing**. It demonstrates my ability to communicate engineering concepts effectively (CLO3) through digital documentation and reflective practice.

## 💬 Section A: Padlet Engagement
*This section fulfills the 2% weightage for individual participation.*

I remained highly engaged in the class Padlet throughout Weeks 1-14. My contributions included:
- **Infographics:** Visual summaries of Image Restoration and Morphological Operations.
- **Resources:** Sharing research articles on AI in Medical Imaging.
- **Peer Feedback:** Actively responding to questions and providing technical insights to classmates.

## 🧠 Section B: Personal Reflection
*This section fulfills the 3% weightage for depth of thinking and self-awareness.*

In this course, I have transitioned from understanding images as simple files to viewing them as discrete 2D signals. Key areas of growth include:
1.  **Technical Insight:** Mastering the Frequency Domain (DFT) to remove periodic noise.
2.  **Problem Solving:** Overcoming algorithm efficiency challenges in our group project.
3.  **Future Impact:** How I plan to apply Digital Image Processing in the field of Computer Vision and AI.
